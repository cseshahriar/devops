what's is docker?
----------------
Docker is an open platform that enables users to develop,
ship, and run applications with ease. Docker software is
packaged as containers- a docker standardized unit.
These containers have all the elements, such as system tools,
libraries, runtime, etc required by the software. In this lesson,
you will learn all the basics of Docker and how to set it up 
along with a guide on choosing the right plan as per your needs.

Docker is an Os-level virtualization software platform that enables
developers and IT administrator to create, deploy and run applications in a docker container with all their dependencies

where is docker used in devops?
planing(git) -> building(gradle) -> testing(Selenium) -> deployment(docker) -> monitoring(nagios)

Advantage:
----------
Rapid deployment
portability
better efficiency
fast configuration
scalability
security

how does docker works?
----------------------


Client        |
   |          |
Docker CLI    |
   |          |
REST API      | docker client
   |          |
Server        |

components of docker
--------------------

Docker client and server
docker images
docker registry
docker container

docker client:
docker engine or docker is a client server application
that builds executes containers using docker components

docker client -> REST API -> 

[docker client]
      | REST API 
docker host 
[
    docker daemon
    [
        container
        container
    ]

    docker registry
    [
        images
    ]
    
]

docker images
-------------
A docker image is a template of instructions which is used 
to create containers

A docker image is built using a file called docker file
it is comprised of multiple layers
it is comprised of multiple layers
by default docker image starts with a base layer

[docker file ] - [docker image] -> [docker container]

[
    layer 3
    layer 2
    layer 1
    base image layer(ubuntu 18.04)
]



docker image components of docker 
-----------------------------------
consider an example of docker image consisting of four layers

from ubuntu 18.04
PULL ./file
RUN make /file
CMD python /file/file.py


container layers (R/W)   |
CMD python /file/file.py |
run make /file           |
pull ./file              |
from ubuntu 18.4         |
